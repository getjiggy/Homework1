## Overview and Origin

* SetLabs

* Nov 2017

* Alex Soong, Felix Feng, Inje Yeo, Justin K Chen

* The company was created to develop tools enabling developers to bundle Cryptocurrencies, NFTS, Onchain Securities, and Tokens into singular baskets, known as Sets.

* The company has been funded by multiple private entities, of which the publicly disclosed amount is $16,000,000. They are currently in Series A of funding. 


## Business Activities:

* The company is trying to solve the problem of creating ETF-like products for blockchain assets of all types. 

* The company is targeting financial institutions and money managers. They have stated that they do not anticipate large numbers of Sets being created to the extensive gas cost involved in deployment. With the number of institutions and money managers expanding into crypto-assets, there will be sizeable interest in creating these etf like products. I believe it in the future it will be comparable or even larger than the number of institutions/money managers interested in traditional packaged products such as ETFs or ETNs.

* Currently, Set protocol is offering to asset managers the ability to use ETF like products to help manage customer funds. This is a unique set of tooling which makes managing their clients assets much easier and intuitive for institutions and asset managers. 

* The company is leveraging the ability of ERC20 tokens to wrap around other assets such as Ether, ERC20, ERC721, and other token types used on blockchain. Their current products are deployed on Ethereum and Polygon. 


## Landscape:

* Blockchain/cryptocurrency asset management

* Given the relative newness of the industry, there are few players in this specific space. However, the company's flagship product, the DeFi Pulse index, has received expansive and continuous growth in its assets under management or what SetLabs is referring to as Market Cap. At the time of writing there are 14000 unique holders of the Set, with total Market Cap of $138,697,492.79. 

* There are other companies offering crypto asset management solutions but none of which seem to be developing open source tooling for asset managers in the same way as Set. These companies include C3, Cabo, Blox, Coinbase etc. 


## Results

* The business impact of Set protocol so far has been the creation of ETF like products composed of on chain assets. These ETF-like products are essentially ERC20 tokens composed of other ERC20 tokens such as Uni, Link, COMP, AAVE etc. 

* Market capitilization is the leading metric used to track the success of Set's products. So far there is more than $360 million of assets across all of SetLabs token sets. 

* I have been unable to find any direct competitors to Set protocol's token sets. As far as I could tell, they are the only company developing these types of on chain solutions to asset management. There is competition with Set's current leveraged products, such as 2x leveraged Eth. While other companies in the DeFi space do offer leveraged trading on ETH, few if any offer leverage using the same mechanism as Set. Set uses tokensets to offer their leveraged products which are collaterized on chain by other products, such as the LINKETH2x Long set. Other margin trading services, such as DyDx use centralized order book solutions and cannot offer their leveraged services in the United states. As far as I could find, Set's leveraged products do not suffer from this restriction. 


## Recommendations

* I would advise the company to integrate more Layer 2 solutions and deploy on chains that utilize such solutions. Arbitrum, and Optimism would be excellent layer 2 solutions to target in order to reduce the cost of deploying a set.

* I would also advise that the company continue to innovate in the development of crypto-related financial tools. Perhaps by partnering with other companies working on bringing other financial products to the crypto-space. These could involve leveraged products, bonds, or derivatives. 

* Building out on more layer 2 solutions would allow SetLab to provide management services to more managers who are interested in exposing their customers to other layer 2 solutions.. Setlabs should also continue fleshing out additional financial tools for managers and customers to use. They could integrate with other protocols who are developing tooling for products such as leverage, bonds or derivatives. 


* Layer 2 blockchain solutions and other protocols. 

* These solutions are appropriate because they allow the products accessible by a wide range of users. By integrating with existing protocols creating leveraged, derivative, or income producing assets SetLabs will be able to offer a more diverse asset management tool suite to asset managers.
